## Web-based learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this publicly accessible homepage we create on GitHub. Here you will find learning materials, tasks, and support. Open questions can be asked at any time during the course or via comments/email. All questions will be discussed in a screencast or online (FAQ).

## Flexible learning with fixed deadlines
The course schedule provides for a two-to four hour block. These events we√≠ll be offered in classroom and as possible as live stream. 
At every course meeting we start with a new course unit. For these you will find new learning materials on this website. These can be videos, texts, exercises, references to literature etc. 

Apart from the given deadlines, you are free to organize your learning and work on the tasks. 


## Learning with Web Conferences
In addition to providing materials on this website, we want to meet with you in web conferences. This is subject to the expected Internet load and other technical problems that may prevent you from participating in a web conference. Subject to the consent of each participating student, we will record the web conference to provide you to all those who were unable to participate due to technical or other barriers.

Short-term changes e.g. of the web conference room can always occur. These changes will be communicated to you by email.
