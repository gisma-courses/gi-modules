To start with, get yourself a GitHub account if you have not one already and create your learning log repository. Be aware that once the learning log repository is created, you will stick to this until the end of the course.


Once you have a GitHub account, you can create as many repositories as you like at your account and invite any team members you want. 
Within this course you will submit your solutions for the course assignments to a private GitHub-hosted learning log, i.e. a   personal repository which you have to share with the instructor. 

If not stated otherwise, the deadline for an assignment is the date and time of the next course session. The submissions generally encompass R or R markdown with compiled PDF files.


Aside from submitting assignments, you should use your repository (or arbitrary other repositories) for everything related to this course which is a potential subject to version control, team collaboration and issue tracking.
