      <description>LiDAR data and LAS data format Technically spoken the LiDAR data comes in the LAS file format (for a format definition i.e. have a look at the American Society for Photogrammetry &amp;amp; Remote Sensing LAS documentation file). One LAS data set typically but not necessarily covers an area of 1 km by 1 km. Since the point clouds in the LAS data sets are large, a spatial index file (LAX) considerably reduces search and select operations in the data.</description>

      <description>How to get started? For this first example we take a typical situation: - we have no idea about the software and possible solutions - we have no idea about LiDAR data processing and analysis - we just google something like lidR package tutorial
Among the top ten is The lidR package book .</description>

      <description>A few snippets to practice he following snippets fit in principle with the logic of the previous approach. They are adapted to tree level. However, we have already learned that we can also choose other aggregation concepts. Then they have to be adapted accordingly.
Above all, they show how sub-scaled satellite land use and LidAr data can be merged into one parameter set.
